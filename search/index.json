[{"content":"It all began on a chilly morning in Phagwara, Punjab. Three friends—Sanjai, Fadhil, and Hafeeem—decided to embark on an unforgettable adventure: hitchhiking to Nepal for bungee jumping in Kushma. With a budget of just ₹3,000 for 8 days and ₹6,000 for bungee jumping, we were ready to test our limits and make memories that would last a lifetime.\nChapter 1: The Journey Begins We started our journey from Jouned, full of excitement and a little nervousness. Our first ride came from a lorry driver named Fasal. He was a character—loud, funny, and slightly drunk, but he got us safely to our next stop.\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

He was a quiet, kind man who shared stories about his travels and even bought us tea at a roadside dhaba.\nChapter 3: The Scammer Not everyone we met was kind. One guy promised to take us to Kushma but dropped us halfway after taking some money. It was a lesson learned, but we didn’t let it dampen our spirits.\nChapter 4: Meeting Locals Along the way, we met an old Nepali man who shared his lunch with us. His warmth and hospitality reminded us why we love traveling.\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a link to the video instead.

He was the life of the party!\nChapter 7: Bungee Jumping in Kushma Finally, we reached Kushma. The bungee jumping experience was worth every penny.
