It all began on a chilly morning in Phagwara, Punjab. Three friends—Sanjai, Fadhil, and Hafeeem—decided to embark on an unforgettable adventure: hitchhiking to Nepal for bungee jumping in Kushma. With a budget of just ₹3,000 for 8 days and ₹6,000 for bungee jumping, we were ready to test our limits and make memories that would last a lifetime.

## Chapter 1: The Journey Begins

We started our journey from Jouned, full of excitement and a little nervousness. Our first ride came from a lorry driver named Fasal. He was a character—loud, funny, and slightly drunk, but he got us safely to our next stop.

## Chapter 2: The Kindness of Strangers

From Sonoili to Butwal, we hitched a ride with Nitish Pathway in his BYD car. He was a quiet, kind man who shared stories about his travels and even bought us tea at a roadside dhaba.

## Chapter 3: The Scammer

Not everyone we met was kind. One guy promised to take us to Kushma but dropped us halfway after taking some money. It was a lesson learned, but we didn’t let it dampen our spirits.

## Chapter 4: Meeting Locals

Along the way, we met an old Nepali man who shared his lunch with us. His warmth and hospitality reminded us why we love traveling.

## Chapter 5: Fake Redbull and Tent Space

In Nepal, we discovered the infamous fake Redbull. It tasted... interesting. That night, a kind local offered us space to pitch our tent. He even shared his dinner with us.
