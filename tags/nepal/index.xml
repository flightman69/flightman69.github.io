Three friends—Sanjai, Fadhil, and Hafeeem—decided to embark on an unforgettable adventure: hitchhiking to Nepal for bungee jumping in Kushma. With a budget of just ₹3,000 for 8 days and ₹6,000 for bungee jumping, we were ready to test our limits and make memories that would last a lifetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="chapter-1-the-journey-begins">Chapter 1: The Journey Begins
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We started our journey from Jouned, full of excitement and a little nervousness. Our first ride came from a lorry driver named Fasal. He was a character—loud, funny, and slightly drunk, but he got us safely to our next stop.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>From Sonoili to Butwal, we hitched a ride with Nitish Pathway in his BYD car. He was a quiet, kind man who shared stories about his travels and even bought us tea at a roadside dhaba.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not everyone we met was kind. One guy promised to take us to Kushma but dropped us halfway after taking some money. It was a lesson learned, but we didn’t let it dampen our spirits.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In Nepal, we discovered the infamous fake Redbull. It tasted&amp;hellip; interesting. That night, a kind local offered us space to pitch our tent. He even shared his dinner with us.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="chapter-8-reflections">Chapter 8: Reflections
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This trip cost us only ₹3,000 for 8 days, with an additional ₹6,000 for bungee jumping. It was a budget trip, but the experiences were priceless. From the kindness of strangers to the hilarious misadventures, every moment was unforgettable.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This journey taught us that the best adventures come from stepping out of your comfort zone and embracing the unknown. Nepal, with its breathtaking landscapes and warm-hearted people, will always hold a special place in our hearts.&lt;/p>
